# Info

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a set of TypeScript design patterns in practice.
The project demonstrates how one can connect and use Google Maps API.

I will use a tool called `parcel-bundler`, that helps run TS in the browser:
`$ npm install -g parcel-bundler`

How parcel-bundler works:

- we will create in our project an index.html file
- inside **index.html** we will include a script tag for a file called **index.ts**
- we will feed **index.html** into parcel & parcel will compile **index.ts** to **index.js**

In order to start parcel:
`$ parcel .\index.html`
